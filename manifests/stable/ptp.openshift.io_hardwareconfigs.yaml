                          Behavior defines the system behavior based on synchronization sources, conditions and
                          associated actions. The conditions for the sources can be "default", "locked" or "lost".
                          The "default" condition initializes the hardware in each subsystem to allow the "Acquiring" state.
                          Bidirectional links between different subsystems can remain disconnected, as the desired link
                          direction is still unknown. The "locked" condition in one of the subsystems will configure
                          the bidirectional links to be disciplined by the locked subsystem. If more than one subsystem
                          is locked, the source with the smaller index will have higher priority. If the active source
                          is lost, and no other sources are "locked", the subsystem of the last active source may enter
                          holdover (subject to the daemon holdover decision). Other subsystems will be connected to
                          follow the DPLL in holdover.

                                Condition defines a condition that evaluates an array of sources with implicit AND logic between them.
                                The first condition in the array is the Triggering Condition, while all others are Supporting Conditions
                                (that must be true for the desired states to be applied). For example, if two different subsystems have
                                two different sources, there is still only one subsystem that will activate holdover if all other sources are lost.
